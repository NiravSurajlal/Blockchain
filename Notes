Routing: See auth.py register function. See blog.py, update for 'requires and argument'. 

Session: is a dict that stores data across requests. When validation succeeds, the user’s id is stored 
in a new session. The data is stored in a cookie that is sent to the browser, and the browser then sends
it back with subsequent requests. Flask securely signs the data so that it can’t be tampered with.
See auth.py login function. 

Endpoint: Name associated witha view is called an endpoint.

ADDITIONS TO API
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- The posts need to be a brief header, which takes to another page with details.
- Each user will require a User and Post ID columns for who they pay 
- Each user will require a  status column of their post 
- Every post needs to have a 'Give a Loan' button that can be clicked by everyone.
- This takes to a page where the terms can be seen.
- Another button to confirm transaction which will add it to the blockchain. 
- Should update DB, indicate satisfied, and not allow further loans.

BLOCKCHAIN
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Add block to sql database (not to py obj)
Block should consist of:                        |Using loan SQL table?
    - block index (on chain)                    |- id
    - unique user ID, username or id (use id)   |- loan_author_id and request_post_id
    - transaction amount                        |
    - timestamp of transaction                  |
    - hash of previous block                    |
    - nonce                                     |

    - chained_status
    - hash of itself
    (SQL)
    - FOREIGN KEY (block_author_id) REFERENCES user (id)

Blockchain should consist of:
-
    (SQL)
    - FOREIGN KEY (blockchain_author_id) REFERENCES individual_block (block_author_id)

Merkle Trees:
    - https://www.codementor.io/blog/merkle-trees-5h9arzd3n8 
    - Requires DB each block with hashes of each transaction and one for actual chain
        -> stores all hashes 
        -> counts number in it (2 for now)
        -> stores root hash  
    - using time.time() for time in hash, should use from DB (datetime not json viable)

Genesis Block:
    - Add to init_db() in db.py
    - First block and first block appended to chain 
    - Also remember to add X for # of transactions in Blocks, i.e. initialise Block/ Blockchain 
        - Add to Genesis Block class and set here

SECURITY

- Need encryption of data going to and for
- Encrypt data when select 'Give' so that username etc is encrypted
