###### Brings in the hash, checks if block is full, if it is allows it to be mined, if successful adds it to chain
###### Both the individual blocks and chain are 2 SQL tables, individual_block & blockchain respectively 
###### They are related by 'block_id' in blockchain being tied to 'id' in individual_block  
###### func which takes in the hashes as a string and converts to list obj first 
###### prev block automatically started when old one ends
